For example, a loan applicant is desirable or not depending on his/her income, previous loan and transaction history, age, and location. Even if these features are interdependent, these features are still considered independently. This assumption simplifies computation, and that's why it is considered as naive. This assumption is called class conditional independence.\n","\n","$$ P(h|D) = \\frac{P(D|h)P(h)}{P(D)} $$\n","\n","- $P(h)$: the probability of hypothesis h being true (regardless of the data).

In practice, it is almost impossible that model will get a set of predictors which are entirely independent.\n","- If there is no training tuple of a particular class, this causes zero posterior probability. In this case, the model is unable to make predictions. This problem is known as Zero Probability/Frequency Problem.\n","\n","## Conclusion\n","Congratulations, you have made it to the end of this tutorial!\n","\n","In this tutorial, you learned about Naïve Bayes algorithm, it's working, Naive Bayes assumption, issues, implementation, advantages, and disadvantages. Along the road, you have also learned model building and evaluation in scikit-learn for binary and multinomial classes.\n","\n","Naive Bayes is the most straightforward and most potent algorithm. In spite of the significant advances of Machine Learning in the last couple of years, it has proved its worth. It has been successfully deployed in many applications from text analytics to recommendation engines"]}]}
